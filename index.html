<h1>Panchami</h1>

<div style="display: flex;">
<p>Since I have been to Pakur, I didn‚Äôt know what was going on in Kolkata. If you haven‚Äôt seen my Trip to Pakur journey, click on ‚ÄúTrip to Pakur‚Äù to access the site. It was Panchami when we were returning. It was 19:00, so you know what would I expect.. It was all light. I was confused that if it is day or night, I need to check mobile at that time (Just Kidding, I just exaggerated). (Returning from journey is a very tough work, though.) I was all exhausted. So, Panchami was not very nice to me because I had to see lights through the train and cannot see any durga idol üò≠.</p>

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h1>Shashthi</h1>

<div style="">

<p>Shashthi morning, a sunny day, I cannot believe it is the month of October, too much rise in temperature. Morning was going like a normal routine, doing the regular stuff like eating, studying, playing and most importantly, coding (I forgot many tagnames, as it was a long time back since I had coded on 20 September 2021). 	Afternoon went away with eating foods and watching Beyblade (Yes, I love beyblade, favourite series:- Metal series). (I think there will be no need of QNA, though if needed, I will). So much offtrack uff‚Ä¶ So on evening, my father came home and told us to visit the Pandal near our house. So me, my mother and my father went to visit the nearby Pandal. </p>

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h2>Planning to go to Netaji Colony</h2>

<div style="">

<p>I and my mother insisted my father to visit the Netaji Colony Pandal. It was a big Pandal in our locality. (From viewers outside of West Bengal, I highly recommend you to visit West Bengal in Durga Puja time. You will enjoy. But be carefull about the roads. Crowd is very much high in Shoshthi, Soptomi, Aushtomi, Nobomi and Doshomi). So, after that we decided to go to Netaji Colony. We visited many Pandal in the road. But one thing was very much annoying, the sound system was in very much high volume (Although, you would be offended by my statement cause it was not way very much high, but for me it was a too much high.) </p>

<img  style="min-width: 100%;border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 20px; " src="Netaji Colony.jpeg">
<p  style="margin-left: 10px;padding: 10px;background-color: black; border-radius: 10px;border: 2px solid white;">Netaji Colony, Kolkata</p>
</div>
</div>

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h2>Netaji Colony</h2>

<div style="">

<p>The Pandal in Netaji colony was a little bit simple in this year, 2021. Before Pandemic, Netaji Colony‚Äôs Pandal was very much special; it was formed based on a theme. As we entered the Pandal I saw a big Kalash. I don‚Äôt know what it was made up of (I think it was made up of mud or cement... Don‚Äôt know exactly.) As we pass through every Pandal, I saw the ‚Äòmurti‚Äô of god and goddesses. First I saw of Lord Ganesh and Goddess Laxmi. Then I saw Goddess Durga. This murti was too much big. I was amazed when I saw it. Next was of Lord Kartik and Goddess Saraswati. Then suddenly I found myself outside the gate, I expected more but now, this was the end. </p>

</div>
</div>

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h2>Shoshthi  Sorted</h2>

<div style="">

<p>After that, we go to many Pandal on the other way. After a half hour walk. We decided to go home. I was eager to visit more place but I also agreed cause we didn‚Äôt bought the umbrella and if there is rain, we would not get any shelter. (Though it didn‚Äôt rain. I was a little bit sad but I knew ‚ÄòDurga Puja ki to abhi Shuruat hi hui hai‚Äô).</p>

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h1>Soptomi </h1>

<div style="display: flex;">
<p>On this day‚Äôs morning and afternoon went like Shoshthi‚Äôs day. On the evening my mother urged my father to take us to their office‚Äôs Pandal. Before that we had planned to go to Sreebhumi but it was too much far from our home. That‚Äôs why it was cancelled. </p>
</div>

</div>

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h2>Bandhudal Sporting Club Pandal </h2>

<div style="">

<p>But before going there we went to Bandhudal Sporting Club. It was on the way to my father‚Äôs office. It was decorated beautifully. BT Road was very much crowded (Although, We had also contributed to this crowd.)Pandal was a way too much big in size. This pandal on durga puja, is very much crowded but on this durga puja, very less people were there in ratio of other durga puja time. We entered the building and then visited the Pandal. It was as big as of Netaji Colony‚Äôs. Then after visiting a retail shop, we now decided to go to my father‚Äôs office.</p>

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h2>Pandal in Bonhoogly</h2>

<div style="">

<p>My father‚Äôs office is situated in Bonhoogly. Near there are so many Pandal. Why mother was excited to come here has a reason. We stayed in Bonhoogly for almost 7 years (Though I only live for three years)  before we go to Dehradun. Now after staying for 7 years in Dehradun, we were back in Kolkata. My family had enjoyed here. I lived there for three years only cause I was born there after 4 years of my parent and my sisters staying in Bonhoogly. Now back on the track, As we were going we saw many Pandals. The one on the main road, in the colony, in the way to the office, there were many Pandals. After visiting every Pandal, we decided to go home.</p>

<img  style="min-width: 100%;border-radius: 10px; height: 60vw; margin-top: 20px; " src="Pandal in Bonhoogly.jpeg">

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h1>Aushtomi</h1>

<div style="">

<p>We didn‚Äôt visited anywhere in Aushtomi</p>

<p>üò∞</p>
</div>
</div>

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h1>Nobomi</h1>

<div style="">

<p>I don‚Äôt know why but after summarizing my day, it is all same with other day except the evening. On this day‚Äôs morning and afternoon went like Shoshthi‚Äôs and Soptomi‚Äôs day. (Why am I humming Beyblade theme song  ü§¶) Nobomi evening was without my father as my father has gone out of station. Me and my mother started our journey through the Mandal Para. Going through the road, I saw many Pandals that were beautiful. (I really recommend everyone to visit Kolkata or any other place in West Bengal in Durga Puja) Then we go to Bediapara, then there also unique and beautiful Pandals. Numerous Pandals were there on the road.

</div>

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h2>Dum Dum</h2>

<div style="">

<p>Then after Bediapara we took an auto to Dum Dum. (Why wasn‚Äôt the crowd was at highest level as I expected??) After a while or two we reached Dum Dum. We roamed till the Seven Tanks road. Seven Tanks Road‚Äôs Pandal was as expected, was situated in the middle of the road. Then after praying we went to the Dum Dum Road. This road was decorated with ‚Äò lichu‚Äô lights (as I say) or it might be.. Ladiyan, yes it is. Walking was also a little bit tougher as we crossed the Seven Tanks. After reaching the station, we ate some food stuffs and then after that we started our (Though we were ending) journey.  But there is something at the end. Read more to know.</p>

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h2>Binayak Hospital Pandal</h2>

<div style="">

<p>We stepped in to our auto at Dum Dum Station and travelled till the Binayak Hospital, as I stepped out of the auto, I saw the place with colours lights. (But sound system was also beatin g my mind) This Pandal was based on the theme of ‚ÄòAzadi ke pachahattar (75) varsh‚Äô Top of the building was filled with the saffron, white and green color. Durga Mandap was decorated beautifully. I video called my sister (As my sister had gone to its college and missed the Durga Puja in Kokata) and my nani After journey filled with happiness and also tireness we now get to home.</p>

<div style="padding: 15px;text-align: center;">

<h1>Dashami</h1>

<div style="">

<p>Dashami wasn‚Äôt too much nice for me cause I was feeling week and then many of the Idols were drowned. That‚Äôs why when we visited Mandal Para (Though one wasn‚Äôt drowned) I saw no idols in the road. We went Baisakhi but there also we can‚Äôt find any Idols.</p>

<h2>Pandal in Bonhoogly</h2>

<div style="display: flex;padding: 20px;">
<p>My father‚Äôs office is situated in Bonhoogly. Near there are so many Pandal. Why mother was excited to come here has a reason. We stayed in Bonhoogly for almost 7 years (Though I only live for three years) before we go to Dehradun. Now after staying for 7 years in Dehradun, we were back in Kolkata. My family had enjoyed here. I lived there for three years only cause I was born there after 4 years of my parent and my sisters staying in Bonhoogly. Now back on the track, As we were going we saw many Pandals. The one on the main road, in the colony, in the way to the office, there were many Pandals. After visiting every Pandal, we decided to go home.</p>

<h1>Nobomi</h1>

<div style="display: flex;padding: 20px;">
<p>I don‚Äôt know why but after summarizing my day, it is all same with other day except the evening. On this day‚Äôs morning and afternoon went like Shoshthi‚Äôs and Soptomi‚Äôs day. (Why am I humming Beyblade theme song ü§¶) Nobomi evening was without my father as my father has gone out of station. Me and my mother started our journey through the Mandal Para. Going through the road, I saw many Pandals that were beautiful. (I really recommend everyone to visit Kolkata or any other place in West Bengal in Durga Puja) Then we go to Bediapara, then there also unique and beautiful Pandals. Numerous Pandals were there on the road.</p>

<h2>Dum Dum</h2>

<div style="display: flex;padding: 20px;">
<p>Then after Bediapara we took an auto to Dum Dum. (Why wasn‚Äôt the crowd was at highest level as I expected??) After a while or two we reached Dum Dum. We roamed till the Seven Tanks road. Seven Tanks Road‚Äôs Pandal was as expected, was situated in the middle of the road. Then after praying we went to the Dum Dum Road. This road was decorated with ‚Äò lichu‚Äô lights (as I say) or it might be.. Ladiyan, yes it is. Walking was also a little bit tougher as we crossed the Seven Tanks. After reaching the station, we ate some food stuffs and then after that we started our (Though we were ending) journey. But there is something at the end. Read more to know.</p>

<h2>Binayak Hospital Pandal</h2>

<div style="display: flex;padding: 20px;">
<p>We stepped in to our auto at Dum Dum Station and travelled till the Binayak Hospital, as I stepped out of the auto, I saw the place with colours lights. (But sound system was also beatin g my mind) This Pandal was based on the theme of ‚ÄòAzadi ke pachahattar (75) varsh‚Äô Top of the building was filled with the saffron, white and green color. Durga Mandap was decorated beautifully. I video called my sister (As my sister had gone to its college and missed the Durga Puja in Kokata) and my nani After journey filled with happiness and also tireness we now get to home.</p>

<h1>Dashami</h1>

<div style="display: flex;padding: 20px;">
<p>Dashami wasn‚Äôt too much nice for me cause I was feeling week and then many of the Idols were drowned. That‚Äôs why when we visited Mandal Para (Though one wasn‚Äôt drowned) I saw no idols in the road. We went Baisakhi but there also we can‚Äôt find any Idols.</p>
